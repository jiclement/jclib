class jclib\+::\+Counted\+Pointer\+Safe$<$ T $>$}

A template child class that permits automatic \& static variables to have counted pointers. The user must ensure that all Counted\+Pointers to instances of this class

NB\+: It is not generally safe to have Counted\+Pointers point at automatic or static variables as when the pointer count reaches zero an attempt will be made to delete the variable.
